Frontline Coding Challenge

This repository contains a solution to the Frontline Coding Challenge as a C# .NET Console Application.

The project contains classes for ProblemOne and ProblemTwo as they are described in the challenge directions.  These classes derive from a ProblemBase class which is extended for common properties in both string manipulation solutions.

A static StringHelper class is utilized to encapsulate most of the string manipulation functions required in developing this solution.

The output is writen to the console window to prove the solution concepts have been fulfilled in this exercise.  The code could ultimately be used in a library project referenced by a web, web service or windows forms solution as well.

Full source code for the solution resides in the Frontline dir.

A compresssed version of the source code can be downloaded as Frontline.zip

Console window output displaying the solution to the challenge can be viewed in FrontLineConsoleOutput.rtf
